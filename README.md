### Triangulations and Trivalent Graphs of Quarks

To each nuclear particle we associate harmonic oscillator in a parabolic potential well which we can make into a periodic (extended) cogwheel model by using methods in [Surface Algebras I: Dessins D'enfants, Surface Algebras, and Dessin Orders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.06750) and [Surface Algebras and Surface Orders II: Affine Bundles on Curves](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.00621) to extend t'Hooft's cogwheel model of [quantum cellular automata](https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1548) pg. 23. Think of this extended cogwheel as an infinite covering of t'Hooft's cogwheels. 

*In the continuum limit (for higher dimensional qudits) this becomes an infinite covering of the circle. A restriction to discretized Planck time may be prudent in which case the partition of the circle would either be finite if the radius is such that the planck length angle divides the circumference evenly, or it would become an irrational rotation algebra otherwise.*
